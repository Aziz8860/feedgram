# Feedgram
Developed a personal project utilizing React Native (Expo) to build a social media application. This app leverages Supabase for its backend, enabling real-time updates to the timeline and instant notifications. Users can seamlessly login and register, and the app facilitates the sharing of posts to a central timeline. To foster community engagement, the platform allows users to interact with each other's posts through a commenting system. This project is intended to enhance my understanding of React Native and its capabilities in developing mobile applications for social interaction, while also exploring the benefits of utilizing Supabase's real-time functionalities.

## Features

### 1. Upload post to timeline
User can upload a picture or video to timeline. The format is using text rich (HTML format). After upload, the user can edit the post as well

### 2. Interact with other's post
User can like and comment to a post. The user will be notified when a comment is added

### 3. Edit profile
User can edit profile through the profile page

## Future Plan
- Make the count of likes and comments become realtime
- Use custom backend so it doesn't rely on third parties
